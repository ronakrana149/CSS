      In this blog post weâ€™re going to be looking in detail at exactly what CSS is, and how developers use it to create the visual element we enjoy when looking at our favorite websites.The content is essentially the elements which make up the page. For example, the text, images, and headings make up the content. Content is written in HTML, short for HyperText Markup Language. In short, HTML is responsible for defining the content and structure of a web page.

      The presentation is the visual representation of the elements on the page. This is where CSS comes in.
